.SH "NAME"
\fBpig-prop\fR - Show the values for one or more Pig variables or properties, as defined in "pig.properties".
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBpig-prop\fR [\fI--help\fR] [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The pig-prop(1) command returns the values for one or more Pig variables or properties.
It determines the property values by locating the "pig.properties" configuration file.
\fBNOTE:\fR Only reads the first property file it finds. Unlike \fIhive\fR, we can't 
easily run Pig and have it dump the properties.
