# try-until-or-die - Wait for an expression to succeed until a specified time.
# usage: try-until-or-die time Mx
# The first argument is the point in time when waiting will stop, specified
# in epoch seconds. 
# The second argument is how long to wait between attempts in seconds specified
# as "Mx", where the optional x is one of 'h', 'm', or 's' (default).
# The remaining arguments are the bash expression to try on every iteration. 
# It must return a status of 0 when evaluated to indicate success and nonzero for
# failure. For example, "ls foo" returns 1 unless "foo" exists, in which case
# it returns 0.
# If the wait times out, it dies. Contrast with bin/try-until.
# NOTE: The process will sleep between attempts.
# See also the other try-* scripts.
